# What is this
This is Yukkuricraft's [terraform](http://terraform.io/) repo. Terraform is an infrastructure-as-code solution for defining and deploying infrastructure in a deterministic and reproducable manner.

## Okay so YC?
We use a combination of AWS and GCP at the moment. We will try to migrate away from AWS and define all new GCP resources via our Terraform config.

We will ultimately house all YC infra that isn't the physical server box itself with GCP+Terraform. This includes our DNS, our sandbox/toolbox hosts, bots (maybe), etc etc.

## Deploying Terraform Changes
#### Coming Soon
